# üß™ Upload-to-Download Flow Test Guide

## üéØ **Testing the Complete File Sharing Flow**

This guide will help you verify that uploaded files are accessible to all users through the download page.

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied**

I've fixed several critical issues in the upload-to-download flow:

### **1. Missing File URL in Database**
- **Issue**: Uploaded files weren't storing the file URL in the database
- **Fix**: Added `file_url` and `file_size` to the database record

### **2. Auto-Approval for Demo**
- **Issue**: Uploaded files had `is_approved: false` by default, so they didn't appear in downloads
- **Fix**: Set `is_approved: true` automatically for demo purposes

### **3. Complete File Metadata**
- **Issue**: Missing file size and proper URL handling
- **Fix**: Store complete file metadata including size, URL, and approval status

## üß™ **Step-by-Step Test Process**

### **Test 1: Upload a File (User A)**

1. **Login as User A**:
   - Email: `user1@eastdelta.edu.bd`
   - Create account if needed

2. **Go to Upload Tab**:
   - Fill in title: `"Test PDF Document"`
   - Fill in description: `"This is a test file for sharing"`
   - Select category: `"Computer Science"`
   - Choose file type: `"PDF"`
   - Click file type card to select a file (or it will create a mock file)

3. **Upload the File**:
   - Click "Upload Resource"
   - Should see progress: 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 75% ‚Üí 100%
   - Should see success message with coin reward

4. **Expected Console Logs**:
   ```
   Uploading file: {fileName: "...", filePath: "...", size: ..., type: "..."}
   File uploaded successfully: {path: "..."}
   ‚úÖ Upload successful with file URL and approval
   ```

### **Test 2: Verify File Appears in Download Page (Same User)**

1. **Go to Download Tab**:
   - Should see the uploaded file in the list
   - File should show correct title, description, category
   - Should show coin price and download count (0)

2. **Check File Details**:
   - Title: "Test PDF Document"
   - Category: "Computer Science"
   - Author: Your name
   - Price: 5 coins (PDF default price)

### **Test 3: Access File from Different User (User B)**

1. **Logout from User A**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Sign Out
   - Should redirect to login

2. **Create/Login as User B**:
   - Email: `user2@eastdelta.edu.bd`
   - Create new account or login

3. **Go to Download Tab**:
   - Should see the same file uploaded by User A
   - File should be available for download
   - Should show User A as the author

4. **Test Download**:
   - Click download button on the file
   - Should see confirmation dialog
   - Should deduct coins from User B
   - Should increment download count

### **Test 4: Verify Real-Time Updates**

1. **Upload Multiple Files**:
   - Upload different file types (PDF, DOC, Image)
   - Use different categories
   - Verify all appear in download page

2. **Test Search and Filter**:
   - Search for file titles
   - Filter by categories
   - Verify all uploaded files are searchable

## üîç **Expected Behavior**

### **Upload Process**:
```
Select File ‚Üí Fill Form ‚Üí Upload to Storage ‚Üí Save to Database ‚Üí Award Coins ‚Üí Success Message
```

### **Download Process**:
```
Browse Files ‚Üí Select File ‚Üí Confirm Purchase ‚Üí Deduct Coins ‚Üí Record Download ‚Üí Open File
```

### **Multi-User Flow**:
```
User A Uploads ‚Üí File Stored ‚Üí User B Sees File ‚Üí User B Downloads ‚Üí Both Users Updated
```

## üìä **Database Verification**

You can verify the data is correctly stored by checking these tables in Supabase:

### **Check Uploaded Resources**:
```sql
SELECT 
  title, 
  description, 
  file_type, 
  file_url, 
  file_size, 
  coin_price, 
  is_approved, 
  download_count,
  created_at
FROM resources 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Check User Profiles**:
```sql
SELECT 
  full_name, 
  email, 
  total_coins, 
  uploaded_files_count, 
  downloaded_files_count
FROM user_profiles 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Check Downloads**:
```sql
SELECT 
  d.downloaded_at,
  r.title as resource_title,
  up.full_name as downloader_name,
  d.coins_spent
FROM downloads d
JOIN resources r ON d.resource_id = r.id
JOIN user_profiles up ON d.downloader_id = up.id
ORDER BY d.downloaded_at DESC;
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **If Files Don't Appear in Download Page**:
1. Check if `is_approved` is true in database
2. Verify file was uploaded successfully
3. Check console for any errors
4. Refresh the download page

### **If Download Fails**:
1. Check if storage bucket exists and is public
2. Verify file URL is correct
3. Check user has enough coins
4. Look for console errors

### **If File URLs Don't Work**:
1. Verify Supabase storage bucket is public
2. Check storage policies allow public access
3. Ensure file path is stored correctly

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**
